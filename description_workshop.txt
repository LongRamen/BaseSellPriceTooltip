Adds a helpful tooltip showing the base sell price of each item. This mod can also show base buy prices for items sold by NPCs.

You can fully customise when this tooltip is shown (in normal inventory/in NPC shop, always show/toggle with button, etc.)

The mod also includes an alternative shorter format for displaying the prices, as shown in the screenshots. You can choose whether to enable this in the mod settings.
